This is UniversalCoins, a mod made for Minecraft. It has been made open-source by its original creator, TED_996, since he no longer has time to maintain it.

This fork of Universal coins has been updated to Minecraft Forge 1.7.2 and is now maintained by me, notabadminer. 

Original Minecraft Forum thread: http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/1833251-162164 Browse here to understand the reasons for specific decisions, also to understand the way the mod works (and is supposed to work). Links to 1.6.2 versions of the mod can be found in this minecraftforum thread.
