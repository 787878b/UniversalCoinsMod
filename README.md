This is UniversalCoins, a mod made for Minecraft. It has been made open-source by its original creator, TED_996, in order to let the community update it to newer versions of Minecraft. 

This fork of Universal coins has been updated to Minecraft Forge 1.7.2. This mod is in the early stages of development and may not function as expected. CAUTION: It might ruin your world. Do not use on a production server just yet.

Original Minecraft Forum thread: http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/1833251-162164 Browse here to understand the reasons for specific decisions, also to understand the way the mod works (and is supposed to work).

1.6.2 versions of the mod can be found at the minecraftforum thread.
